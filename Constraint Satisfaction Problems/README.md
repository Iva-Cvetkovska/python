# Map of Australia
The idea here is to use 3 colors for each state of Australia, with the constraint that no neighbour has the same color.

# Rooks
On a NxN chess board, how would we align N rooks so that no rook attacks any of the remaining rooks?

# Magic Square 
Just practicing the power of the constraint module and using built in methods to add constraints, such as AllDifferentConstraint and ExactSumConstraint. The requirements are to have different values for each tile and for each row, column and diagonal, the sum of the values should be 34.

<i>The documentation for the module can be found [here](https://labix.org/doc/constraint/).</i>
