# Explorer
The goal is to get our explorer to his house safely, without coliding with existing obstacles that are moving vertically.</br>

# Stars
By using both knight and bishop, we mimic the same movements as in chess and try to collect the randomly placed stars in the most optimal way.</br></br>

*in both cases breadth first graph search is used as the most safe bet for an optimal solution*
