# Welcome! 👋🏻

Here you will find problems I encountered when starting with Python.</br>
Switching from JavaScript to this language really came naturally to me and I still enjoy using it on a daily basis. 

## Short explanation about the folder contents:
**Practise Problems**: used for examples that introduce you to the new syntax and cool features that Python has to offer.

**Search**: implementing problem-solving agents that reach a solution by *searching*, they decide what to do by finding sequences of actions that lead to desirable states.
